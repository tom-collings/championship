## championships per metro area

the idea of this project is to determine which metropolitan area has the most championships relative to the number of professional seasons.  NYC has the most absolute championships for the four major sports (NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB) but has nine seasons every year to accomplish this (Mets, Yankees, Jets, Giants, Nets, Knicks, Islanders, Rangers, Devils).  Atlanta has but one championship and four seasons to try every year (Hawks, Falcons, Braves, Thrashers).  

The first part of this project is to load the seasonal data and correlate it to a metropolitan area.  

Having to do a lot of screen scraping for this.
